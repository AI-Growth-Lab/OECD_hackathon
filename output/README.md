Hi guys, how is it going? Could you all maybe give me a hand and do the following:
 
1. Push all your (optimally commented) r/python scripts in the corresponding folder of our github.
2. Push all your important outputs (tables, figures, rendered notebooks) in the output folder
3. Please also write a brief description of what you have done, where the corresponding scripts are to be found, and how to use them. Optimally, push that as a markdown in the output folder.


Initiatives By Themes folder:
- The policy initiatives are linked based on the common themes.
- The node itself is the policy initiative.
- The edge represents the number of policy initiatives which have more than one theme in the particular year (2016,2017,2021).
- Color shows communities which separate policies clearly based on themes, meaning that the majority of the policies have one main theme. 
- The codes for the plot can be found in Katie_STIP_Compass.Rmd under 4.Network viz of Indicators By themes
