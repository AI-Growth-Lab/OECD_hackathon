Hi guys, how is it going? Could you all maybe give me a hand and do the following:
 
1. Push all your (optimally commented) r/python scripts in the corresponding folder of our github.
2. Push all your important outputs (tables, figures, rendered notebooks) in the output folder
3. Please also write a brief description of what you have done, where the corresponding scripts are to be found, and how to use them. Optimally, push that as a markdown in the output folder.
